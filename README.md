# 419-dataset

Your folder must include a brief README file. It should include:

    The structure of your code/folders so that the TA can easily navigate your project.
    A self-evaluation of your project with respect to your proposal. This is more of a subjective reflection on your project, compared to the scientific report deliverable. Did you do all that you said you would in the proposal? Did you make any changes compared to what you planned to do? Any considerations that the TA should take into account while marking should be written here. 
    If there are special dependencies (e.g. Unity needs to be installed), include instructions here too.
